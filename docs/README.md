# Documentation (`docs/`)

This directory is intended for storing more detailed documentation about the project. Use this space to provide comprehensive information that goes beyond the basic overview in the main `README.md`.

## Suggested Content

Here are some suggestions for what you might include in this `docs/` folder, depending on the complexity and requirements of your project:

*   **`user_guide.md` or `user_manual.md`**:  A guide for users on how to use the final output or application produced by the project. This is relevant if the project results in something that others will interact with.
*   **`technical_documentation.md`**:  Detailed information about the design, architecture, and implementation of the project. This could include:
    *   Explanations of key algorithms or methods used.
    *   Diagrams illustrating the system architecture or data flow.
    *   Detailed descriptions of specific modules or components.
*   **`data_dictionary.md`**:  If the project involves significant data handling, a data dictionary can be very useful. This would describe the different datasets used, their sources, and the meaning of each variable or field.
*   **`design_decisions.md`**:  A document outlining the key design choices made during the project and the rationale behind them. This can be helpful for understanding the project's evolution.
*   **`project_report` or `final_report`**:  Depending on the course requirements, this could be where students place their final project report.

## How to Contribute to the Documentation

*   **Use Markdown:**  Most documentation files should be written in Markdown for easy readability and formatting. An exception is the final report.
*   **Be Clear and Concise:**  Write in a way that is easy for others to understand.
*   **Use Headings and Subheadings:**  Structure your documents logically with clear headings to improve readability.
*   **Include Examples:**  Where appropriate, provide examples to illustrate concepts or usage.
*   **Keep it Up-to-Date:**  Ensure that the documentation accurately reflects the current state of the project.

## Getting Started

As you develop your project, think about the different aspects that would benefit from more detailed explanation. Create new files or folders within this `docs/` directory as needed to document your work thoroughly.

Remember, good documentation is essential for understanding and maintaining a project!
